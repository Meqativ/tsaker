# tsaker
## blazingly slow todo list app

Install:

0. make sure you have Node.js ≥18, and NPM ≥9 installed (didn't test on any older version)
1. clone the repo somewhere `git clone https://github.com/Meqativ/tsaker`
2. cd into the folder
3. update packages `npm i`
4. `node .` to start tsaker

If you want to use the app from anywhere, make an alias for `node {tsaker_folder}`.
